        <p>Morel mushrooms often are found near ash and elm trees but can be found anywhere. Morel mushrooms sometimes grow in a line and patches, if you find one spend time to find others. Best time to find them is in the spring when temperatures are between 40 and 60. Go early in the mourning and you get to watch the sunrise and avoid misquitos. I like to cut the mushroom with pocket knife at ground level leaving the dirt for easy clean up. Take picture of mushroom before you pick it and your phone will store the gps location. I use a mesh bag like a onion bag or orange bag, rinse them off and swing bag around to dry them. When you get home soak them in salt water for few hours to get bugs out and clean them better. Store them dry in fridge untill you are ready to cook them. Use them quickly while they are fresh. Lighlty bread them with flour and fry in pan on medium heat. I also bake them in oven with few slices of bacon. </p>
