        <p>Some products like a detachable spray showerhead can greatly improve quality of life. Another example is Good Grips Swivel Peeler by OXO. Google AI devices along with GE Cync 80-in Smart Plug-in LED Strip Light are a winning combo. Amazon's Alexa AI is more of a AI garage sale shopper next to Google AI. Amazon has a lot of great products at best prices but there is a lot of trash items too. Amazon doorbell cameras are probably pretty cool. Tesla is a once in a lifetime type of company making the world a better place. Sunpower has some of the most advanced top of the line solar products. Spacex is making space accessible and making internet available for everyone everywhere. Le Creuset is well known brand of trusted cookware. Great products don't have to be top of the line and expensive. My favorite saucepan I found on Amazon for 20 dollars. Some things make sense to be cheap and disposable while others are more practical to be well made and long lasting. </p>
